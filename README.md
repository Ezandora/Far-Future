Far-Future
=====
Solve the Time-Spinner [Far Future](http://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/The_Far_Future)
 mini-game in [Kingdom of Loathing](http://www.kingdomofloathing.com).

How do I use it?
----------------
First, install it by running this command in KoLmafia's graphical CLI:

<pre>
svn checkout https://github.com/Ezandora/Far-Future/branches/Release/
</pre>

Then run Scripts Menu > FarFuture.ash. (if it doesn't show up, first try Scripts Menu > Refresh menu.) Or type "FarFuture". It takes one argument, the item you want to replicate:

__Memory__ - Memory Disk, Alpha - Sell in mall for others to play the game.  
__Ears__ - Unstable Pointy Ears - +3 stats/fight accessory.  
__Drink__ - Shot of Kardashian Gin - Epic one-drunkenness drink, gives PVP fights.  
__Food__ - Tea, Earl Grey, Hot - Epic one-fullness food.  
__Mall__ - Whatever sells for the most. (won't add it to store)  
__None__ - Replicate nothing.

So, running "FarFuture food" will play through the far-future mini-game once, collecting two medals and a nice cup of tea.

Far Future will require a [recent daily build of mafia](http://builds.kolmafia.us/job/Kolmafia/).

What does it do?
----------------
The [Far Future](http://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/The_Far_Future) mini-game lets you captain a starship about to fall apart in the span of an episode. This script will automatically earn two medals against the five different adversaries - borg, emoticons, klingons, cloud, and crystals - while replicating your once/day item.
